Current Issues to Fix:
âœ… PDF Generation Failing â†’ Fix and ensure detailed, structured PDF reports.
âœ… Add a Toggle Button â†’ Switch between Simulation Mode (default) and Real Network Tracking using Scapy.
âœ… Remove Unnecessary Code â†’ Optimize and clean up the entire codebase.
âœ… Improve Code Structure â†’ Follow best practices for modularity and efficiency.
âœ… README.md File â†’ Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project.
âœ… Project Explanation Document (.md) â†’ Include functionalities, requirements, features, and screenshots for better understanding.

Required Fixes & Enhancements:
ðŸ”¹ Fix PDF Generation & Reporting
Implement structured, professional reports using ReportLab or PyPDF2.
Include:
Threat Summary (Attack Type, Severity, Source/Destination IPs, Timestamp)
Network Traffic Graphs (Live Insights, Protocol Distribution)
Heat Maps & Attack Patterns
Actionable Recommendations
Ensure one-click report download in PDF format.
ðŸ”¹ Add a Toggle Button for Network Mode
Default Mode: Simulation (Pre-recorded network data)
Real Mode: Scapy-Based Live Network Traffic Capture
Implement Scapy code but disable execution on Replit to prevent errors.
Provide instructions in README.md on how to enable real network tracking.
ðŸ”¹ Code Optimization & Cleanup
Remove redundant/unnecessary code.
Refactor code into modules for better maintainability.
Ensure best practices in Python for performance optimization.
ðŸ”¹ README.md for Project Setup & Usage
Step-by-step guide on installation and running the project.
How to switch between Simulation and Real Mode.
How to generate reports and interpret dashboard insights.
ðŸ”¹ Project Documentation (.md File)
Detailed explanation of functionalities.
List of requirements (tech stack, dependencies).
Description of all features (Attack Detection, Heat Map, Reports, etc.).
Screenshots & GIFs for better understanding.
Final Deliverables:
âœ… Fully Working PDF Generation with Structured Reports.
âœ… Toggle Button for Simulation â†” Real Network Tracking.
âœ… Clean & Optimized Codebase.
âœ… README.md for Installation & Usage.
âœ… Project Documentation (.md) with Functionalities, Features & Screenshots.

ðŸš€ Objective: Ensure a fully functional, well-documented, optimized security dashboard that is easy to use, professional, and structured for real-world applications.
