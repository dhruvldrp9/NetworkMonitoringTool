Project Report: Real-Time Network Traffic Analyzer Using Python and Scapy
1. Introduction
A real-time network traffic analyzer is a security tool designed to monitor and analyze network packets for potential threats. This project aims to develop a system using Python and Scapy to capture, inspect, and detect security anomalies in network traffic.
2. Objectives
* Capture live network packets.
* Analyze packet headers and payloads.
* Detect security threats such as unauthorized access, malware, or unusual traffic patterns.
* Provide real-time alerts and logging.
* Generate statistical insights and visualizations of network activity.
3. Tools and Technologies Required
Programming Language:
* Python (Primary language for implementation)
Libraries and Frameworks:
* Scapy (Packet capturing and analysis)
* Pyshark (Alternative packet analysis using Tshark)
* Socket (Network communication)
* Pandas (Data processing and logging)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualizations)
* Numpy (Data analysis)
* Tshark (Wireshark CLI) (Optional alternative for packet capture)
* Logging module (For event logging)
Operating System:
* Linux (Preferred for raw packet capture)
* Windows (Requires administrator privileges for network monitoring)
4. Functionalities
4.1 Packet Capturing
* Capture packets in real-time using Scapy.
* Filter packets based on protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
4.2 Packet Analysis
* Extract packet details (Source/Destination IP, Port, Protocol, Payload, etc.).
* Analyze headers (Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
* Detect suspicious patterns (e.g., excessive SYN packets for DoS attacks).
4.3 Threat Detection
* Identify known attack patterns (e.g., port scanning, ARP spoofing, DDoS attempts).
* Compare traffic against predefined security rules.
* Apply machine learning for anomaly detection (optional enhancement).
4.4 Logging and Alerting
* Maintain a log file for captured packets and alerts.
* Send alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., email notifications, terminal alerts).
4.5 Visualization and Reporting
* Generate live traffic graphs (protocol distribution, IP communication heatmaps).
* Display packet statistics in real-time.
* Provide a web-based or GUI dashboard (optional feature).

Future Enhancements
Integrating Machine Learning for anomaly detection.
Implementing a Web-based dashboard.
Adding IDS (Intrusion Detection System) features.
