Problem Statement:

Attack simulation and network simulation are not working properly.
Dashboard data remains static instead of showing real-time fluctuations.
Real-time monitoring is broken, threats are not updating dynamically.
Threat detection is missing or not displayed properly.
No historical threat trackingâ€”past incidents should be logged and accessible.
Current threats should be displayed clearly on the dashboard with full details.
Generated reports are too basicâ€”they need to be detailed, structured, and insightful.
Updated Requirements & Features to Fix Issues:
âœ… Real-Time Attack & Network Simulation

Ensure that network attack simulations (DDoS, ARP spoofing, port scanning, etc.) are properly executed and displayed.
Generate randomized, dynamic attack patterns to continuously test the system's responsiveness.
Allow manual testing (e.g., "Simulate SYN Flood" button to trigger an attack and verify detection).
âœ… Continuous, Fluctuating Network Monitoring

Fix static displayâ€”network traffic and alerts should fluctuate in real-time.
Implement WebSockets/Kafka for live updates instead of static API calls.
Introduce live packet flow animations to visualize network traffic dynamically.
âœ… Real-Time Threat Detection & Alerts

Identify & display active threats in real-time (DDoS, brute force, MITM, malware C2 traffic).
Highlight top three current threats with detailed insights (source, destination, attack type, timestamp, severity level).
Integrate real-time logging for every detected event.
Automated alerting system (Email, SMS, Slack webhook support).
âœ… Historical Threat Tracking & Log Page

Dedicated page to store past attacks for auditing and forensic analysis.
Include time-based filters (view threats by date, severity, type).
Implement graph-based analytics (attack trends over time).
âœ… Detailed Security Report Generation (PDF Export)

Fix basic reportsâ€”include:
Network activity summary
Top attacks detected (source, destination, severity, timestamps).
Live traffic snapshots (charts and graphs).
Suggested countermeasures for security teams.
Use ReportLab/PyPDF for structured, professional-grade reports.
âœ… Dashboard UI/UX Improvements

Implement a modern, cybersecurity-themed UI with proper color palettes (dark mode, alert-based color coding).
Real-time animation effects for live data fluctuations.
Threat severity indicator (Low/Medium/High/Critical).
Click-to-investigate threats (expandable details on each attack).
âœ… Tech Stack Upgrades for Performance & Scalability

Frontend: React.js (Next.js, TailwindCSS, D3.js/Plotly.js for interactive charts).
Backend: FastAPI/Flask with Python (Scapy, Pandas, NumPy, ML-based anomaly detection).
Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB for efficient threat logging.
Real-time Data Handling: Redis/Kafka for instant data streaming.
AI/ML Integration: Train and deploy models for anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, LSTM for time-series attack patterns).
Final Deliverables:
âœ… Fully Functional Real-Time Dashboard (Live attack visualization, dynamic updates, interactive elements).
âœ… Attack Simulation Suite (Configurable attack testing, live detection).
âœ… Threat Detection System (Live & historical logging, threat severity ranking).
âœ… Detailed Security Reports (Structured insights, automated PDF export).
âœ… Optimized UI/UX (Modern, responsive, intuitive design).
ðŸš€ Objective: Build a highly responsive, interactive, and professional cybersecurity dashboard that provides real-time insights, forensic analysis, and automated reporting for network security monitoring.
