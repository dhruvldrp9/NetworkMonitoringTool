Problem Statement:

Connection Heat Map & Attack Patterns are not displaying data.
Dashboard layout is unorganizedâ€”tiles must fit on one screen without scrolling.
If additional information is needed, use a two-window split-screen layout.
Recent Activity tile is too longâ€”should have a fixed size with internal scrolling instead of making the entire dashboard scroll.
More network insights should be displayed to improve monitoring.
Add interactive filtering options to allow users to filter threats based on severity, attack type, or source.
Required Fixes & Enhancements:
âœ… Fix Connection Heat Map & Attack Pattern Visibility

Ensure real-time updates in the Connection Heat Map (source-destination mappings).
Properly populate Attack Pattern visualizations (DDoS, Brute Force, Port Scanning, MITM, etc.).
Implement color-coded intensity levels in the heat map (Red = Critical, Yellow = Medium, Green = Normal).
Add zoom and pan functionality to analyze network flows better.
âœ… Optimized Dashboard Layout

Rearrange all tiles to fit on one screen without scrolling.
If additional data is required, introduce a two-window split-screen layout.
Make tiles auto-adjust based on screen resolution (desktop, tablet, mobile).
âœ… Fix Recent Activity Tile (Compact & Scrollable)

Reduce tile size while ensuring all critical notifications remain visible.
Implement internal scrolling within the tile instead of making the entire dashboard scroll.
Enable users to click notifications to expand and view full details.
âœ… Enhance Dashboard with Additional Key Information

Top 5 Source & Destination IPs (show most active network connections).
Protocol Distribution Graph (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, etc.).
Real-time Network Performance Metrics (Packet Loss, Latency, Bandwidth Usage).
Threat Risk Score (Overall system security rating based on detected threats).
Geo-location of Threat Sources (Map-based visualization of attack origins).
Add an Incident Timeline View to see when threats occurred over time.
âœ… Interactive Threat Filtering & Sorting

Filter threats by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
Sort attacks by type (DDoS, Brute Force, Malware, etc.).
Filter by source IP, destination IP, and time range.
Enable toggling between "Live" mode and "Historical" mode.
âœ… Tech & UI Upgrades for Better Performance & Aesthetics

Ensure all visual elements refresh in real-time using WebSockets/Kafka.
Refine UI with a cybersecurity-themed design (dark mode, color-coded alerts).
Use D3.js/Plotly.js for interactive graphs and network insights.
Make layout elements draggable and resizable for user customization.
Final Deliverables:
âœ… Functional Connection Heat Map & Attack Pattern Visualization.
âœ… One-page, non-scrolling Dashboard with optimized tile layout.
âœ… Fixed Recent Activity Tile with internal scrolling & better UI.
âœ… Additional insightful data points for network monitoring.
âœ… Interactive Filtering & Sorting Options for Better Threat Analysis.
âœ… Improved UI aesthetics & real-time performance.
ðŸš€ Objective: Build a clean, interactive, and real-time security dashboard with clear threat visibility, advanced filtering, and seamless user experience.
